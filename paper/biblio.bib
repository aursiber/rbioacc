abstract = {Abstract This study investigated the effect of long-term sediment aging on the toxicokinetics of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and hexachlorobiphenyl (HCBP) using three freshwater benthic invertebrates. Hyalella azteca, Chironomus tentans, and Lumbriculus variegatus were exposed to BaP- and HCBP-spiked sediments that were aged for 7 d or 1.5 years. The toxicokinetics of the two compounds were determined for each test organism using a two-compartment model. The modeling of BaP was more complex because biotransformation was included within the model. The results of this study showed that the HCBP uptake clearance rates (ks) for each species were generally an order of magnitude greater than those determined for BaP and this difference was most likely due to preferential and rapid binding of BaP to sediment particles. Overall, the bioavailability of HCBP in spiked sediments tended to decrease with duration of aging, based on ks values and bioaccumulation factors (BAFs). However, the decreases in bioavailability appear to be species specific. Benzo[a]pyrene did not decline in bioavailability for the species tested because it may resist movement into the micropores of the sediment due to its large size. In addition to the bioassays, this article outlines a method for toxicokinetic modeling of biotransformed compounds and methods for statistical comparisons of kinetic parameters (i.e., ks, kd …) and BAF values.},

This paper presents new perspectives on the generic calculation of bioaccumulation metrics via the innovative web tool MOSAICbioacc (http://mosaic.univ-lyon1.fr/bioacc). MOSAICbioacc provides all kinds of bioaccumulation metrics associated with their uncertainty whatever the species-compound combination. MOSAICbioacc expects accumulation-depuration data as inputs, even with complex exposure and clearance patterns, to quickly perform their relevant analysis. MOSAICbioacc intends to facilitate the daily work of regulators, or any ecotoxicologist, who will freely benefit from a user-friendly online interface that automatically fits toxicokinetic models without need for users to invest in the technical aspects to get bioaccumulation metrics estimates. MOSAICbioacc also provides all results in a fully transparent way to ensure reproducibility. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2021;00:1–9. © 2021 SETAC}

abstract = {Following a request from EFSA, the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) developed an opinion on the state of the art of Toxicokinetic/Toxicodynamic (TKTD) models and their use in prospective environmental risk assessment (ERA) for pesticides and aquatic organisms. TKTD models are species- and compound-specific and can be used to predict (sub)lethal effects of pesticides under untested (time-variable) exposure conditions. Three different types of TKTD models are described, viz., (i) the ‘General Unified Threshold models of Survival' (GUTS), (ii) those based on the Dynamic Energy Budget theory (DEBtox models), and (iii) models for primary producers. All these TKTD models follow the principle that the processes influencing internal exposure of an organism, (TK), are separated from the processes that lead to damage and effects/mortality (TD). GUTS models can be used to predict survival rate under untested exposure conditions. DEBtox models explore the effects on growth and reproduction of toxicants over time, even over the entire life cycle. TKTD model for primary producers and pesticides have been developed for algae, Lemna and Myriophyllum. For all TKTD model calibration, both toxicity data on standard test species and/or additional species can be used. For validation, substance and species-specific data sets from independent refined-exposure experiments are required. Based on the current state of the art (e.g. lack of documented and evaluated examples), the DEBtox modelling approach is currently limited to research applications. However, its great potential for future use in prospective ERA for pesticides is recognised. The GUTS model and the Lemna model are considered ready to be used in risk assessment.},

abstract = {Abstract Recent advances in modeling the processes of the toxicity of chemicals—toxicokinetics (TK) and toxicodynamics (TD)—are improving environmental risk assessment (ERA) through prediction of effects from time-varying exposure. This has been achieved by linking chemical fate and toxicological effects mechanistically, based on internal concentrations, through the tissue residue approach. However, certain questions remain: for example, how do TK and TD differ among species and how does this relate to differences in species sensitivity? In a series of experiments, we studied the TK of [14C]chlorpyrifos in 15 freshwater arthropod species, two of which were studied in juvenile and adult life stages. Uptake (kin) and elimination (kout) rate constants were fitted using a one-compartment single first-order kinetic model. The application of two complementary parameter estimation methods facilitated the calculation of bioconcentration factors (BCF) with prediction intervals and 95\% depuration times (t95) for all tested species. Extremely slow elimination was observed in some species as well as high overall variation in kin, kout, BCF, and t95 across the tested aquatic arthropod species. This variation has implications for the development of TKTD approaches in ERA, including assessing fluctuating exposure concentrations and the interpretation of observed toxicity responses in the laboratory and in the field.

These models describe uptake and elimination processes taking place within living organisms when exposed to chemical substances. The models solved in this paper consider living organisms as a unique compartment, into which a parent compound enters via several possible exposure routes and from which it is eliminated as well as its potential metabolites. Benefiting from generic solutions of one-compartment toxicokinetic models is particularly useful when fitting them to experimental data, facilitating the writing of the inference algorithms leading to parameter estimates. Additionally, these models are of crucial interest in environmental risk assessment for the calculation of bioaccumulation metrics as required by regulators in support of decision making when they evaluate dossiers for marketing authorisation of active substances. &lt;h4&gt;Abstract Figure&lt;/h4&gt; Graphical abstract},

	abstract = {Regulatory bodies requires evaluation of bioaccumulation of chemicals within organisms with the objective to better assess risks linked to the toxicity of active substances. To this end, toxicokinetic (TK) data are particularly useful to relate the chemical exposure concentration to the accumulation and depuration processes happening within organisms. The bioaccumulative property of substances is quantified by bioaccumulation metrics obtained by fitting TK models to data collected from bioaccumulation tests. The internal concentrations of the studied substances are measured within organisms at regular time points during both accumulation and depuration phases, and their time course is captured by TK models thus providing bioaccumulation metrics. Still today, raw TK data remain difficult to access, as most of the time provided within papers in plots only. To increase accessibility to TK data, we present in this paper a wide collection of raw data sets extracted from the scientific literature in support of TK modelling to be performed with the MOSAICbioacc web application (https://mosaic.univ-lyon1.fr/bioacc/).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
